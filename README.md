# Excel Project - School Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data to identify districts with significant deficiencies in school infrastructure and facilities. The goal is to allocate budgets effectively to improve school conditions, promote enrollment, and reduce gender disparities in education. The insights gained will guide sustainable improvements over multiple project phases.

## Tools and Methodology
### Tools Used:
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data analysis, conditional formatting, and labeling.
- **Power BI**: For creating dynamic visualizations and interactive dashboards.
- **Microsoft Word**: For documentation and reporting.


### Data Preparation and Analysis
1. **Conditional Labeling**: 
   - Used IF statements to create additional columns for specific labels based on conditions (e.g., schools without electricity were tagged as "Electricity Needed").
   
2. **Filtering and Sorting**: 
   - Applied filters and sorting to isolate critical subsets, such as schools lacking essential facilities. Districts were sorted by resource availability to identify the most underserved regions.

3. **Error Handling**: 
   - Addressed errors like #NAME in the dataset using Power BI's Power Query Editor.

4. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Ensured unique identifier columns were free of errors. Missing values in non-critical fields were handled without affecting the overall analysis.

5. **Dynamic Visualizations**: 
   - Developed Power BI dashboards with interactive slicers for district, tehsil, and resource availability, enabling more informed decision-making.

## Key Insights
### Critical Deficiencies:
- Schools in certain districts lacked basic amenities such as toilets, electricity, and drinking water. Many also required security measures, functional classrooms, and boundary walls.

### Gender Disparities:
- The need for separate schools for boys and girls was evident, particularly in rural areas, to encourage female education.

### Resource Allocation:
- Boundary walls, building conditions, and functional classrooms received the highest budget allocations due to their high costs and importance. Issues related to water and electricity were less expensive to address and were allocated lower budgets.

## Budget Highlights and Allotment
### Infrastructure and Facilities:
- **Total Allocated**: 60 million PKR
  - Boundary Walls: 10M
  - Functional Classrooms: 7.5M
  - Building Condition: 7.5M
  - Toilets and Security: 2.5M combined
  - Playgrounds and Labs: 5M

### Upgrades and New Schools:
- **Total Allocated**: 190 million PKR
  - Separate Schools: 100M
  - Upgrades: 45M
  - New Primary Schools: 45M

The remaining funds will support multiple phases, ensuring sustainable improvements across the province.

## Marketing and Outreach
- **Localized Social Media Campaigns**: Highlight the specific improvements made to schools in targeted districts. Share success stories and showcase the enhanced facilities and new schools.
- **Community Information Events**: Host informational events in high-need districts to educate families on the new resources and encourage school attendance.
- **Collaborative Partnerships**: Partner with NGOs, community leaders, and government bodies to extend the reach of these campaigns and increase enrollment.
- **Gender-Sensitive Outreach Programs**: Run campaigns emphasizing the availability of separate facilities for boys and girls in middle and high schools, which is crucial in culturally sensitive regions.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the effectiveness of data-driven decision-making in addressing educational disparities. By leveraging advanced Excel techniques and Power BI visualizations, we prioritized urgent needs and planned for scalable improvements. This approach ensures a significant and lasting impact on the educational landscape of Punjab.
